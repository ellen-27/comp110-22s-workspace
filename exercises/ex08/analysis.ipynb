Because the second-highest percent score was a '3' for the understanding value (which is negative), this shows that there is still room for improvement in the course, and because the quizzes appear to be helpful/beneficial/received positive feedback, an increase in the amount of quizzes might be a good change for an increase in understanding. I wish I could organize the data into a binary, to see 'positive' feedback, versus 'negative' feedback, as I feel it would be helpful to compare these two variable (understanding and quizzes). Some potential costs include that each quiz day takes away a lecture day, and therefore less content, so learning might be crammed. TAs might be overwhelmed with grading more quizzes, as well. "
